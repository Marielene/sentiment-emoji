# sentiment-emoji
<h1> Improve emoji predictions with sentiment analysis </h1>
<h3> Introduction & brief overview </h3>
<p>The project focuses on the problem of emoji prediction in tweets. The idea is: given a tweet, the machine learning model will learn to find patterns that would yield different predictions as to what emoji would follow. With that base, I intend to add a sentiment analysis component to the emoji prediction system, that would help the model discern what emoji is most suited for the given text. To keep the sample size manageable, I intend to only focus on the twenty most used emojis. The findings of this project are likely to find use in assisted messaging, text analysis tools, autocomplete bots etc. </p>
<h3> Milestones </h3>
<ol>
  <li> The creation of the base neural network, that would involve looking for patterns in the pre-collected data.</li>
  <li>  The implementation of a sentiment analysis tool within the neural network and using it to determine the associations of specific emojis with a certain sentiment.</li>
  <li> Compiling my findings into the final report</li>
</ol>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>The objective is to compare how does a machine learning model compare to a similar model with the added functionality of sentiment analysis, when it comes to predicting an emoji given a tweet. Essentially, the comparison consists of the results the machine learning model predicts prior to having information on the sentiment analysis, and after being given access to it, and whether this improves the predictions. </p>
